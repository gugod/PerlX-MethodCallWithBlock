=head1 NAME

PerlX::MethodCallWithBlock - A Perl extension to allow a bare block after method call

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use PerlX::MethodCallWithBlock;

    Foo->bar(1, 2, 3) {
      say "and a block";
    };

=head1 DESCRIPTION

PerlX::MethodCallWithBlock is A Perl extension that extends Perl
syntax to allow one bare block follows normal methods calls.

It translate:

    Foo->bar(1, 2, 3) {
      say "and a block";
    };

Into:

    Foo->bar(1, 2, 3, sub {
      say "and a block";
    });

The body of the C<Foo::bar> method sees it as the very last argument.

=head1 NOTICE

This version is released as a proof that it can be done. However, the
internally parsing code for translating codes are very fragile at this
moment.

Also this doesn't work yet:

    Foo->bar {
      say "and a block";
    };
